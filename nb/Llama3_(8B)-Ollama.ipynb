Web Messaging & WhatsApp: Surveys are delivered using the Script Button for conversational surveys in WhatsApp and for all surveys in Web Messaging. For WhatsApp webform surveys, the surveys are automatically sent if survey assignment is set for the queue. For more details, refer to the [Script Configuration for Conversational Surveys Guide ](../survey-scripts-configuration/script-configuration-for-conversational-survey-in-web-messaging-and-whatsapp.md)and for webform approach in Web Messaging, refer to [Script Configuration for Web Messaging Guide.](../survey-scripts-configuration/creating-scripts-manual.md#offer-web-messaging-survey)\\n3. Other Channels (Email, SMS, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Open Messaging and Chat): Surveys are automatically offered once the agent disconnects from the interaction, if survey assignment is set for the queue. For details about using conversational flow configuration for FB Messenger and Instagram, refer to [Conversational Flow Configuration for Facebook and Instagram Guide.](../survey-scripts-configuration/conversational-flow-configuration-for-facebook-and-instagram.md)\\n\\n<div align=\\\"center\\\"><figure><img src=\\\"../.gitbook/assets/conversational (1).jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"188\\\"><figcaption><p>Conversational Survey in WhatsApp</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src=\\\"../.gitbook/assets/webform (1).jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"375\\\"><figcaption><p>Webform Survey in WhatsApp</p></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\nConversational Surveys occur within the same messaging conversation, such as WhatsApp, where survey questions and responses appear as interactive message options or buttons within the chat. This keeps the survey experience consistent and convenient for customers within the original conversation.\\n\\nWebform (Link-Based) Surveys are delivered as a link sent to the customer. Upon clicking, the link opens a webform in a browser, where the customer can complete the survey.\"\n",

[Survey Timeout Actions](../introduction-to-feebak/surveys/#survey-timeout-settings) will also allow you to handle incomplete surveys effectively, ensuring you get as much feedback as possible.\\n Leverage Rules and Actions: Close the feedback loop by setting up [Rules and Actions](../introduction-to-feebak/surveys/#rules-and-actions) to trigger automatic follow-ups or tasks based on specific conditions or responses. This ensures that important feedback doesn’t slip through the cracks and timely action can be taken.\\n Enable Voice and Digital Open Feedback: For more comprehensive insights, use Voice Feedback to collect open-ended responses from users in voice surveys. Similarly, enable Feedback Notes for digital channels like WhatsApp, and Instagram to capture users' detailed thoughts and suggestions in their own words. This helps you gain a deeper understanding of customer sentiment.\"\n",

        "    \"output\": \"### Understanding Rate Limits\\n\\nRate limits are thresholds set on API endpoints to control the volume of requests that a client can make within a specified period, typically measured in requests per minute (RPM) or requests per second (RPS). These limits help maintain the performance, availability, and reliability of Feebak's services, ensuring that all users have fair access. By defining the maximum number of requests allowed, rate limits prevent abuse, manage unexpected traffic patterns, and encourage efficient use of resources, ensuring accuracy and responsiveness. They also promote more thoughtful interaction with the API, as users are encouraged to consider how they utilize the available resources. While most rate limits are published and regularly updated alongside new features, Feebak reserves the right to adjust existing limits, introduce new ones, or enforce undocumented limits when deemed necessary to protect the system and its users. This approach allows Feebak to maintain flexibility in managing its services and ensures that the platform remains robust and equitable for all users.\"\n",

        "    \"input\": \"\",\n",
        "    \"output\": \"To handle rate limits effectively, it's crucial to implement strategies that ensure your application behaves correctly when limits are reached. The most basic approach is to monitor for HTTP 429 status codes, which indicate that the rate limit has been exceeded, and implement a retry mechanism. Identifying rate-limited requests is straightforward: the HTTP response code will be 429, and the response will contain a Retry-After header. It's important to note that while HTTP headers are case-insensitive, many SDKs store them in case-sensitive map structures, so accessing the Retry-After header may require using the exact case.\\n\\nThe retry mechanism should follow an exponential backoff schedule, which gradually increases the time between retries. Adding randomness to the backoff schedule can help prevent a thundering herd effect, where multiple retries occur simultaneously, potentially overwhelming the server. When implementing retries, applications should respect the Retry-After header, which indicates the number of seconds to wait before making another request. This header is included in all 429 responses and certain 5xx-level responses under specific circumstances. Requests without this header should not be automatically retried.\\n\\nOptimizing individual requests can only go so far. A more advanced approach is to manage request traffic at a global level by throttling requests when substantial rate limiting is detected. One effective method is implementing a token bucket rate limiting algorithm on the client-side. This algorithm allows requests to be made at a controlled rate and slows down or pauses when limits are reached. Ready-made implementations for token bucket algorithms are available in most programming languages. By combining these strategies - monitoring for 429 responses, respecting the Retry-After header, implementing exponential backoff with jitter, and using client-side rate limiting - applications can handle rate limits gracefully and maintain efficient interaction with the API.\"\n",

This feature empowers organizations to balance customer engagement with data collection, reducing survey fatigue and enhancing both customer satisfaction and the quality of insights gathered.\\n\\nWith the Survey Frequency Manager, you can control survey offerings based on two key frequency control options: interaction limits and time-based frequency limits. Interaction limits regulate survey offerings based on the number of customer interactions, while frequency limits allow you to define the maximum number of surveys offered within a specified time frame. These options provide flexibility to tailor survey offerings according to your business needs.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Survey Frequency Manager offers a high level of customization with its scope settings. Rules can be applied universally across all channels and queues or narrowed down to specific combinations of channels and queues. This granularity allows you to create multiple configurations that align with your organizational requirements, ensuring surveys are offered at the right moment and to the right audience.\"\n",

Whether you need to separate data by department, location, or any other criterion, divisions make it easier to manage access and ensure that users interact with the right set of data.\\n\\nHow Divisions Work: Divisions allow you to group resources such as surveys, users, queues, and outbound interactions into specific segments. For instance, if your organization operates in multiple regions or departments, you can create divisions for each and assign relevant resources to them.\\n\\nManaging Access Through Roles: Roles in Feebak can be linked to specific divisions, meaning that users with those roles will only have access to the data within their assigned divisions. This ensures that users interact only with the information relevant to their division, enhancing both security and efficiency. For example, a user with the \\\"Survey Admin\\\" role in the \\\"Sales\\\" division will only be able to manage surveys within that division.\\n\\nImpact on Dashboards and Reports: The division-based setup also influences what is displayed in your dashboards and reports. Data is filtered based on the divisions assigned to the user, ensuring that only the relevant interactions and survey results are visible. This approach helps maintain a focused and organized workflow for users across different segments.\\n\\nDivision-Aware Entities: In Feebak, several entities are division-aware, meaning they can be linked to specific divisions. These include:\\n\\n Surveys\\n Users\\n Queues\\n Outbounds\\n\\nThis setup allows you to assign these resources to the relevant divisions, ensuring that they are managed according to the organization's structure.\\n\\nWorking with Divisions:\\n\\n Assigning Divisions: When assigning roles to users, you can specify which divisions they should have access to. By default, roles are set to \\\"All Divisions,\\\" but this can be adjusted to meet specific needs. Refer [Roles Management](../roles-management.md#edit-roles).\\n Division Management: Feebak provides a dedicated page for managing imported divisions. Here, you can import, sync, and delete divisions as needed. Refer [Division Management](./).\\n Impacted Pages: Several pages within Feebak, such as the User Detail, Role Detail, and Survey Assignments pages, are influenced by the divisions assigned to users. This ensures that all actions and views are consistent with the division-based setup.\\n\\nBy utilizing divisions in Feebak, you can effectively manage and organize your resources, ensuring that users have the appropriate access and that data is segmented according to your organization's needs. This not only enhances operational efficiency but also maintains data security and relevance across different segments.\"\n",
